# Oscilloscope

A single-channel "oscilloscope" for the EMF 2022 TiDAL badge. 

Input is on pin G0. DO NOT apply more than 3.6 V to this pin, or any other pins!

If you don't have an input you can touch the pin and pick up some 50 Hz mains hum.

## Controls

Up/down - change vertical scale

Left/right - change timebase. Keep pressing right to activate roll mode above 1 sec/div.

Hold A + up/down to change the trigger level.

## Future

I'd like to have the option to use the accelerometer as an input source. Pull requests welcome for that and any other features!

## Notes

Not in any way associated with Agilent Technologies, who don't even make scopes anymore.
